      personal notes, ToDo's and other stuff to remember
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * where/when is R_WobbleskyTexGen called? GLSL render path doesn't need it 
   anymore, because the wobble effect is implemented in the skybox vertex shader
   * less work on CPU
   * less data to be transferred from CPU to GPU
   * but: probably not that important... only a couple of vertices are usually 
     used for skyboxes anyways...

 * RB_ARB2_RenderSpecialShaderStage: code for megatextures is disabled... 
   * re-enable? does it work? not used in original game, no shaders available, but
     might be interesting to look at... 
   or
   * remove?

 * Shader/Program Setup: GLSL programs (vertex attributes and uniforms)
   are configured in a lot of different places in the code. Everywhere it happens a
   bit different, because other uniforms are needed and texture slots are used for
   different things. Thats pretty messy right now :(
   All that stuff should be handled in a more generic and consistent way.

     * move uniforms to uniform buffers, so they don't must be uploaded again after
       every program switch?
     
     * replace S and T vec4s of textureMatrices (diffuseMatrixS, diffuseMatrixT, same
       for normal and specular) by a full mat4 (makes some things a bit easier)

     * replace named texture matrices (e.g. diffuseMatrix) by more generic 
       textureMatrix0 ... textureMatrixN? Do the same for diffuseColor, specularColor? 
       not sure if thats really useful...
